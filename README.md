This project implements a specialized power supply. It accepts either AC mains or DC input, rectifies it to a DC bus, and generates a square-wave output derived from that bus (approximately equal to the bus/rectified voltage). The output frequency is firmware-controlled—1 kHz by default—and can be reconfigured to other values.

**Input ranges**
- DC: 32–400 VDC  
- AC: 24–230 VAC
